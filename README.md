# loan_reliability_project
This project looks at how family status and the number of children influence whether people repay their loans on time. The goal is to help the bank improve its credit scoring system by uncovering meaningful patterns in borrower behavior. The work includes cleaning up the data, analyzing trends, and sharing practical insights.
